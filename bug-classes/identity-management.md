# Identity Management

## Account Creation
- If you you aren't asked to verify your email on account creation:
  - Try creating an account with their email domain (me@target.com). You may bypass email whitelisting or gain a privileged account.
- If account creation requires approval
  - Try resetting the password to see if this skips the approval step.

## Invitations
- From account A, send an invite to account B and try accepting on account C
